# How to Play Hold'em Poker Chess

Hold'em Poker Chess is basically [Texas Hold'em Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_'em) but with a spatial element inspired by [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess).

The basic differences are:

1. Cards are associated with Chess pieces and inherit the way they *attack* on the grid of cards like the Chessboard grid.
2. You have to attack cards from the center to include them in your hand. The cards don't move once placed though.
3. Whenever you bet you can choose to place one or both of your *hole* cards facedown on the card grid around the center cards to *attack* them and secure your hand (or it could just be a bluff!)
4. It *is* possible to attack your opponents cards and include them in your hand! But you won't know what they are until the showdown (the reveal of cards).
5. At the showdown you make a normal poker hand that includes any hole cards you have left, plus your choice of the cards you *attack* from the center. If you include an *attacked* card, you must also include the *attacking* card, but you can't chain (i.e. include an attacked card of a card you have attacked.) 

These are the basic rules, some explanations and examples should make the rest clear.

## Chess Cards

An explanation of how each card *attacks*. Often the high poker value cards have powerful chess attacks to match but there are some differences, the *Ace* is the *Bishop* and the *Ten* is the *Rook*.
